# conrod_latest_glium
just [conrod_glium](https://github.com/pistondevelopers/conrod), but with updated [glium(v0.32.1)](https://github.com/glium/glium) and easier event handling
## why? 
because of this:

## how to use it?
there is an example in this repo

also you need to add some dependencies in your project: glium(obviously) and conrod_core
## anything else?
there are two functions for easier event handling(you can see one in action in example)

i'm not planing to change something else in conrod_glium
## crates.io? 
idk actually

i just updated one dependency and added 2 functions for easier event handling in conrod_glium, so i don't know
